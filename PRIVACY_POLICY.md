# Privacy Policy for TokenPeek Extension

**Last updated:** December 2024

## Overview

TokenPeek is a Chrome extension that helps designers and developers inspect semantic design tokens and typography on web pages. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our extension.

## What Data We Collect

**We collect NO personal data from you.**

TokenPeek operates entirely locally on your device and does not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your browsing history
- Send data to external servers
- Store any information about you or your activities

## What Data We Process

The extension only processes design token information from web pages you visit while using the extension:

- **Design token names** (e.g., `--ds-body-md`, `--color-primary`)
- **CSS property values** (font sizes, weights, line heights)
- **Element styling information**

This data is:
- Processed locally on your device
- Never transmitted anywhere
- Automatically cleared when you close the page
- Used solely to display token information in the extension's UI

## How We Use Data

The minimal data we process is used exclusively to:
- Display design token information when you hover over elements
- Show computed CSS values for typography
- Provide the core functionality of the extension

## Data Storage

- **No data is stored permanently** on your device
- **No data is stored in the cloud**
- All processing happens in memory and is cleared when you close the page

## Third-Party Services

TokenPeek does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or external systems.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, you have no personal data to access, modify, or delete. The extension operates entirely within your browser's sandbox.

## Children's Privacy

TokenPeek is not intended for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the version number and date in the extension.
